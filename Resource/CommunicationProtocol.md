## Summary
Group 2 has committed to meeting multiple times a week on Zoom outside of designated class time to collaborate and delegate specific tasks amongst our group members. When not in a meeting, we communicate via Slack to update each other on the status of our specific tasks as well as coordinate schedules. While meeting, we make contributions to a shared Google Document that keeps a running log of each meeting, what is discussed, what is delegated, and what has yet to be delegated. This document is also referenced outside of class to remind each group member of what everyone should be working on.

Group 2 is dedicated to maintaining professionalism and upholding a deep respect for every other group member's time, input, and experience.
