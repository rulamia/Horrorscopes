                    <h3> Does crime happen more during certain astrological seasons? </h3>

                    <p>The final results from the Logistic Regression Model on the KC Crime Dataset included an Accuracy
                        Score of 10%. This percentage was raised by 1% after standardizing the data with StandardScaler
                        from
                        sklearn, altering the train-test split to 70/30, and changing the Random State to 1 instead of
                        42.
                        After reviewing the datasets provided, it was noted the data was organized in a way that could
                        be
                        causing the low accuracy. I chose to shuffle the data in the train_test_split phase, but this
                        did
                        not alter the results at all.</p>

                    <p>Following the results showing a slight improvement of accuracy on the KC Crime Dataset, I
                        implemented similar updates on the Serial Killer dataset. After standardizing the data with
                        StandardScaler and altering the train-test split to 70/30, the accuracy score is now 11%. Just
                        like
                        the other dataset, shuffling the data during train_test_split did not change the outcomes.</p>

                        the amount of false positives is high. The recall scores are also quite low, meaning the
                        proportion
                        of actual positives correctly classified are low. The F1 score, a combination of the precision

                        If this analysis were to continue, the datasets should be re-analyzed to make sure they are not
                        set
                        up in any sort of order that can skew the machine learning models. Attempting a cluster model
                        like K
                        Nearest Neighbors may show more accurate results on both datasets. Changing the features or
                        introducing new data to the datasets to use as new features could also change the outcome of the
                        Machine Learning performed during this project.

                        either. Cell service? Scoff. Just your feet, your friends, and your own, world-famous can-do
                        spirit. Thatâ€™s what you thought when you parked your car on the side of the highway in Nowhere,
                        Colorado. Now itâ€™s dark. Youâ€™re scared, lost and youâ€™re not sure youâ€™ll survive this little

                        I guess he shouldnâ€™t have blamed you for getting them lost.

                        and erratic. Your experiments are considered all Bunsen burner, no compounds. Professor Honeydew
                        has told you that, without a major breakthrough, youâ€™ll never make tenure while theyâ€™re in
                        charge of the department. Thatâ€™s no problem, Prof. Honeydew wonâ€™t live forever. And it looks

                    <small>Family is so important, itâ€™s the reason you get up in the morning. You can tell what your
                        spoiled kids want just by the way they utter your parental moniker. No matter how they might
                        dismiss your feelings, youâ€™ll do whatever it takes to support them. Nothing will keep you from
                        nurturing the offspring that verbally gut you every day before you cry yourself to sleep at
                        night. Not even Nosey Nussbaum, the neighborhood interloper. Of course, itâ€™s kind of difficult
                        for her to rat out your kidâ€™s schoolwork-for-hire scheme after that blunt force trauma. Youâ€™ll
                        just have to con your teen into helping dispose of the body.

                    <small>Combining your business ambitions with your desire to help people, you partnered with a
                        therapist to open a wellness retreat. You found a beautiful tract of land with great facilities
                        for your start-up. Despite your partners warnings about the neighbors, you invested. Surely, 10
                        acres would be plenty of cushion between your clients and the locals. Your repeated requests
                        that they respect you and your clients fall on deaf ears; more accurately, obstinate ears. You
                        just canâ€™t stand their backwards attitude towards your goals. But youâ€™re through paying to clean
                        up the mess they make along the stream. But youâ€™re no criminal mastermind, so it took no time
                        for you to get arrested when your rivalâ€™s patriarch turned up stiff & bloated in that same
                        stream.

                        nights and weekends analyzing products and developing a long-term plan. Things are going well,
                        even if you must keep a tight leash on Chet. He keeps pushing for riskier options, his work is
                        sloppy, and he makes you second guess yourself and thatâ€™s not how you got this far. You remind
                        him that itâ€™s your account, he tells you to calm down. He attempts to change one of the
                        investments for something you knew would tank; itâ€™s more than you can stand. Fortunately for
                        you, he and his yacht â€˜disappearedâ€™ during an extended weekend in Key West. You were sure you

                    <small>Youâ€™ve always loved all things obscure, occult, and strange, even as a child. When you
                        learned sword swallowing, it seemed only natural to start your own side show. It was easy enough
                        to convince performers to join your troupe with your outgoing magnetism. Keeping it together is
                        another story. The whole lot is overly sensitive, too involved and generally disagreeable over
                        your management. However, arbitrary changes in plans and expectations keep them guessing; from
                        show times to pay scales, nothing is consistent. The resident knife-thrower accuses you of
                        skimming the till, so you learn knife-throwing yourself. To show dominance, you call them
                        together to show them your new skills. You figure grazing the conjoined twins would be harmless,
                        but the blade got away from you. The troupe now needs another set of conjoined twins, and you
                        need a good defense attorney.

                    <small>New relationship energy is powerful, and your new flame swept you off your feet. Lately
                        theyâ€™ve had a tough go, having lost their job at the restaurant. You donâ€™t mind paying the
                        bills, but they wonâ€™t even Uber or follow-up on job postings youâ€™ve shared. Meanwhile youâ€™ve
                        been working overtime and cutting back on yourself. Gaming has been your one and only respite,
                        but they sold their console to have money for drinks this weekend. With friends youâ€™ve never
                        heard of before. You can see through the lies and wonâ€™t abide their cheating ways. At least
                        youâ€™ll keep others from getting hurt, or so you thought until you got that text saying your
                        partner never showed up for drinks. Theyâ€™re gonna call the cops.
